                            What Is Smilealign and How Does It Work?

                                    What are aligners made of, and what do they look like?
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>The virtually invisible aligners, which are made of a thermoplastic
                                                material uniquely developed for the Smilealign treatment plan, look
                                                similar to teeth-whitening trays. A series of Smilealign aligners are
                                                custom-made for you, to move your teeth in the sequence determined by
                                                your doctor.</p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    How do the aligners straighten teeth?
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>Over the course of treatment, you will be supplied with a series of
                                                aligners. Each aligner will make slight adjustments to tooth position, a
                                                process that is mapped out in advance by your doctor, specifically for
                                                your situation. When the aligners are placed on the teeth, they cause
                                                the teeth to gradually shift from their current position. After
                                                approximately two weeks, you will begin using the next set of aligners,
                                                which will continue the teeth straightening process.</p>

                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    How will Smilealign effectively move my teeth?
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p>Through the use of our patented thermoplastic design, Smilealign aligners
                                                move your teeth through the appropriate placement of controlled force.
                                                The main difference is that Smilealign not only controls the force, but
                                                also the timing of the force application. During each stage, only
                                                certain teeth are allowed to move. These movements are determined by
                                                your doctor as he or she maps out your unique Smilealign treatment
                                                plan.</p></li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    What are the primary benefits of Smilealign?
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><p>Smilealign aligners are virtually invisible. No one may even notice that
                                                you're wearing them, making Smilealign a seamless fit with your
                                                lifestyle. Smilealign aligners are removable. For the best results and a
                                                timely outcome, aligners should be worn for 20 to 22 hours per day.
                                                However, unlike with braces, you have the flexibility to remove your
                                                aligners to eat and drink what you want during treatment. And you can
                                                also remove the aligners to brush and floss as you normally would, for
                                                fresh breath and good oral hygiene. There are no metal brackets or wires
                                                that could cause irritation to your mouth, an advantage over traditional
                                                braces. Plus, since your office visits during treatment don't involve
                                                metal or wire adjustments, you'll likely spend less time in the doctor's
                                                chair. Smilealign allows you to view your virtual results and treatment
                                                plan before you start so you can see how your straightened teeth will
                                                look when your treatment is complete. Instead of imagining how much
                                                better it can be, you'll be able to see it for yourself.</p></li>

                                                The length of treatment depends on the severity of your case and can
                                                only be determined by your doctor; however, the average case takes about
                                                12 months for adults. The length of time necessary for a teen patient
                                                may vary and can be determined by your doctor.

                                                It's simple — first take our Smile Assessment to see if Smilealign is
                                                right for you. Next make an appointment with an Smilealign Provider.
                                                Many doctors offer free initial consultations. For the best experience,
                                                take the time to find the "right" doctor, one whom you feel comfortable
                                                with, and who has experience treating cases like yours. As with other
                                                important medical decisions, sometimes it is worthwhile to seek out a
                                                second or even third opinion. Use our Find A Doctor feature to find the
                                                most experienced Smilealign-trained Provider near you. Make sure you
                                                trust your smile to an experienced doctor who uses the latest
                                                techniques.

                                                All dentists interested in treating patients with Smilealign must attend
                                                and complete specialized instructional sessions to become trained
                                                Smilealign Providers. In addition, doctors must regularly submit
                                                treatment results for review and complete ongoing clinical training
                                                classes to earn the designation "Preferred Provider." Use our Find A
                                                Doctor feature to find the most experienced Smilealign Provider near
                                                you. Doctors designated as Premier Preferred Providers have a greater
                                                level of case experience. Those labeled Elite Preferred Provider have
                                                the highest level of case experience.

                                                We find that aligners are most effective when worn 20 to 22 hours per
                                                day and removed only for eating, brushing and flossing.

                                                Your doctor will schedule regular appointments usually about once every
                                                four to six weeks. The goal of these visits is to ensure that your
                                                treatment is progressing as planned.

                                    My provider mentioned "attachments". What are they and why would I need them for my
                                    Smilealign treatment?
                                    <ul>

                                                Depending on your specific treatment, some of the movements may require
                                                either "attachments" or "ridges" to help the aligner grip the teeth.
                                                These bumps, or wells, are where the aligner grips the attachment the
                                                doctor places on your teeth. The attachments are actually small pieces
                                                of enamel-colored composite the doctor affixes to your teeth that are
                                                then gripped by bumps on your aligners. The ridges are slim indentations
                                                in your aligners. Your doctor will use one or both of these features to
                                                attempt to achieve the desired tooth movement.

                                    What are the primary benefits of Smilealign?

                                                Smilealign aligners are virtually invisible. No one may even notice that
                                                you're wearing them, making Smilealign a seamless fit with your
                                                lifestyle. Smilealign aligners are removable. For the best results and a
                                                timely outcome, aligners should be worn for 20 to 22 hours per day.
                                                However, unlike with braces, you have the flexibility to remove your
                                                aligners to eat and drink what you want during treatment. And you can
                                                also remove the aligners to brush and floss as you normally would, for
                                                fresh breath and good oral hygiene. There are no metal brackets or wires
                                                that could cause irritation to your mouth, an advantage over traditional
                                                braces. Plus, since your office visits during treatment don't involve
                                                metal or wire adjustments, you'll likely spend less time in the doctor's
                                                chair. Smilealign allows you to view your virtual results and treatment
                                                plan before you start so you can see how your straightened teeth will
                                                look when your treatment is complete. Instead of imagining how much
                                                better it can be, you'll be able to see it for yourself.

                                                While Smilealign moves your teeth without the pain and anxiety metal
                                                braces can cause, some people experience temporary discomfort for a few
                                                days at the beginning of each new stage of treatment. This is normal and
                                                is typically described as a feeling of pressure. It's also a sign that
                                                Smilealign is working, as it moves your teeth to their final
                                                destination. This discomfort typically goes away in a couple of days.

                                                The length of treatment depends on the severity of your case and can
                                                only be determined by your doctor; however, the average case takes about
                                                12 months for adults. The length of time necessary for a teen patient
                                                may vary and can be determined by your doctor.

                                                No. The aligners must be in place a minimum of 20 to 22 hours a day for
                                                the treatment to be effective.

                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                Similar to other orthodontic treatments, Smilealign aligners may
                                                temporarily affect the speech of some people, and you may have a slight
                                                lisp for a day or two. However, as your tongue gets used to having
                                                aligners in your mouth, any lisp caused by the aligners should
                                                disappear.
                                            </p>

                                    Are there restrictions as to what I can eat while in treatment?
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                No. Thanks to the removable nature of the aligners, you can eat and
                                                drink whatever you want while in treatment. In fact, you're required to
                                                remove your aligners to eat and drink. So, unlike when undergoing
                                                traditional treatment using wires and brackets, there is no need to
                                                restrict your consumption of any of your favorite foods and snacks
                                                unless you are instructed otherwise by your doctor. Also, it is
                                                important that you brush your teeth after each meal and prior to
                                                reinserting your aligners to maintain fresh breath and proper hygiene.

                                            <p>
                                                We discourage smoking while wearing aligners because it is possible for
                                                the aligners to become discolored.

                                    Can I drink alcohol with the aligners in?

                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                Because of the high sugar content in alcohol, a moderate amount would be
                                                fine to consume, as long as care is taken to clean the teeth and the
                                                aligners soon after so as not to trap sugar between them. The same
                                                applies for any sugary beverage.

                                                No, gum will stick to the aligners. We recommend removing your aligners
                                                for all meals and snacks.

                                                We find that aligners are most effective when worn 20 to 22 hours per
                                                day and removed only for eating, brushing and flossing.

                                                Your doctor will schedule regular appointments usually about once every
                                                four to six weeks. The goal of these visits is to ensure that your
                                                treatment is progressing as planned.

                                                It is very unlikely that your aligners would ever fall out, no matter
                                                what you were doing at the time: sleeping, talking, laughing, etc. The
                                                aligners are designed to fit firmly on the teeth, so this should not be
                                                a cause for concern.

                                                similar to teeth-whitening trays. A series of Smilealign aligners are
                                                custom-made for you, to move your teeth in the sequence determined by

                                                No. Smilealign aligners and Vivera Retainers do not contain Bisphenol-A

                                                The best way to clean your aligners is to use the Smilealign Cleaning
                                                system, available for order at www.smilealigners.in As a secondary method,
                                                however, your aligners can also be cleaned by brushing them and rinsing
                                                them in lukewarm water.

                                    Will I need to wear a retainer after treatment to prevent my teeth from moving

                                                Most doctors recommend that anyone who has completed orthodontic
                                                treatment, whether braces or Smilealign treatment, use a retainer to
                                                prevent teeth from gradually shifting back towards their initial
                                                position. Because every case is different, please speak to your doctor
                                                to confirm if you need post-treatment retainers, and if they are needed
                                                for both upper and lower teeth.

                                                While there are many different types of retainers, we recommend Vivera®
                                                retainers. Vivera’s proprietary material is 30% stronger than other
                                                leading clear retainer materials, which helps maintain your teeth in the
                                                final position. Because the retainers are custom made from an impression
                                                or scan of your teeth using the same state-of-the-art technology as
                                                Smilealign clear aligners, you will benefit from a more precise and
                                                comfortable fit.

                                                so you can have an extra pair in case they are lost and/or misplaced.

                                                A number of Smilealign patients have undergone a previous treatment
                                                involving braces at some point in their past, often during their youth.
                                                Adults can usually have the shifting that occurs after braces corrected,
                                                without having to go through the trauma and social awkwardness of
                                                wearing metal braces.

                                                Please consult with your Smilealign Provider about any special
                                                orthodontic cases, such as veneers.

                                    I currently have bridgework on several teeth. Will Smilealign still work?
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                Because bridgework involves the connection of a tooth to surrounding
                                                teeth, it would be difficult for the aligners to work effectively. The
                                                aligners are designed to move each tooth separately, following the exact
                                                movements that your orthodontist will map out for you when creating your
                                                custom-made aligners.

                                    How much does Smilealign cost?
                                    <ul>

                                                We know cost is a big question for anyone considering orthodontic work.
                                                In most cases, Smilealign treatment is comparable to the cost of
                                                traditional braces. However, as with other medical treatments, only your
                                                Smilealign-trained doctor can determine the cost, based on your specific
                                                needs. Other factors may include your treatment goals, the difficulty of
                                                your case, how long you are in treatment, where you live, and additional
                                                factors determined by your dentist or orthodontist. Also, check your
                                                dental insurance plan—Smilealign treatment is covered by many dental
                                                insurance policies. And many doctors can offer flexible and affordable
                                                monthly payment plans as well.

                                                Because medical benefits differ significantly from policy to policy, you
                                                should review your personal coverage plan. However, in general, if a
                                                patient has orthodontic coverage, Smilealign should be covered to the
                                                same extent as conventional braces.

                                                Most doctors will help you find options to make your treatment
                                                affordable. Many offices offer flexible and affordable monthly payment
                                                plans. Many doctors also offer financing through CareCredit.

                                                The length of treatment depends on the severity of your case and can
                                                only be determined by your doctor; however, the average case takes about
                                                12 months for adults. The length of time necessary for a teen patient
                                                may vary and can be determined by your doctor.

                                    Sometimes when I remove my aligners, my teeth feel loose. Is that common?

                                                Yes. As your aligners gradually shift your teeth into their proper
                                                position, your gums are re-forming around each tooth as it moves. Once
                                                your treatment is complete and your teeth are evenly spaced, your gums
                                                will adhere snugly to the teeth in their new positions.

                                    Are there restrictions as to what I can eat while in treatment?

                                                No. Thanks to the removable nature of the aligners, you can eat and
                                                drink whatever you want while in treatment. In fact, you're required to
                                                remove your aligners to eat and drink. So, unlike when undergoing
                                                traditional treatment using wires and brackets, there is no need to
                                                restrict your consumption of any of your favorite foods and snacks
                                                unless you are instructed otherwise by your doctor. Also, it is
                                                important that you brush your teeth after each meal and prior to
                                                reinserting your aligners to maintain fresh breath and proper hygiene.
                                                Remember that aligners are most effective when worn 20 to 22 hours per
                                                day and removed only for eating, brushing and flossing.

                                                We discourage smoking while wearing aligners because it is possible for
                                                the aligners to become discolored.

                                    Can I drink alcohol with the aligners in?
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                Because of the high sugar content in alcohol, a moderate amount would be
                                                fine to consume, as long as care is taken to clean the teeth and the
                                                aligners soon after so as not to trap sugar between them. The same
                                                applies for any sugary beverage.

                                    Can I chew gum while wearing aligners?

                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                No, gum will stick to the aligners. We recommend removing your aligners
                                                for all meals and snacks.

                                                We find that aligners are most effective when worn 20 to 22 hours per
                                                day and removed only for eating, brushing and flossing.

                                                Your doctor will schedule regular appointments, usually about once every
                                                four to six weeks. The goal of these visits is to ensure that your
                                                treatment is progressing as planned.

                                                The length of treatment depends on the severity of your case and can
                                                only be determined by your doctor; however, the average case takes about
                                                12 months for adults. The length of time necessary for a teen patient
                                                may vary and can be determined by your doctor.

                                    I went on a trip and forgot to take my aligners with me. Will my aligners still fit?

                                                The answer depends on how long you've gone without wearing them. If for
                                                a short period of time, the aligners should still be able to fit over
                                                your teeth. You might feel slight discomfort as your teeth readjust to
                                                the aligners. If the lapse in time is significant, please consult your
                                                Smilealign Provider. He or she will be best prepared to respond to your

                                                The best way to clean your aligners is to use the Smilealign Cleaning
                                                system, available for order at www.smilealigners.in. As a secondary method,
                                                however, your aligners can also be cleaned by brushing them and rinsing
                                                them in lukewarm water.

                                    If I have food residue (like blueberries or pasta sauce) in my mouth when I put my
                                    aligners back in, can they become stained?

                                                Yes. That's why it's important to brush after every meal, before placing
                                                the aligners back in your mouth.

                                    I dropped my aligners in an unsanitary place. Do I need to sterilize them after I
                                    clean them?
                                    <ul>

                                                It is very important to always ensure your aligners are clean and
                                                hygienic before placing them in your mouth. That's why Smilealign offers
                                                its Cleaning System with special Cleaning Crystals. They keep your
                                                aligners clean, hygienic and clear. And as an added bonus, the Cleaning
                                                Crystals also quickly remove plaque, in as little as 15 minutes. Please
                                                do not use hot water at any time on your aligners as this may cause
                                                irreparable warping of the plastic.

                                            <p>
                                                Please contact your Smilealign Provider. A cracked aligner will not be
                                                able to provide the necessary amount of pressure for proper tooth
                                                movement, so the aligner will need to be replaced. You should act on
                                                this as soon as possible so as not to cause your teeth to shift back
                                                into their old position while a replacement aligner is created for you.

                                    Will I need to wear a retainer after treatment to prevent my teeth from moving

                                                Most doctors recommend that anyone who has completed orthodontic
                                                treatment, whether braces or Smilealign treatment, use a retainer to
                                                prevent teeth from gradually shifting back towards their initial
                                                position. Because every case is different, please speak to your doctor
                                                to confirm if you need post-treatment retainers, and if they are needed
                                                for both upper and lower teeth.

                                                While there are many different types of retainers, we recommend Vivera®
                                                retainers. Vivera’s proprietary material is 30% stronger than other
                                                leading clear retainer materials, which helps maintain your teeth in the
                                                final position. Because the retainers are custom made from an impression
                                                or scan of your teeth using the same state-of-the-art technology as
                                                Smilealign clear aligners, you will benefit from a more precise and
                                                comfortable fit.
