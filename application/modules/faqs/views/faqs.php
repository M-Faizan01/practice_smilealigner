                                Smilealign aligners are removable. For the best results and a timely outcome, aligners
                                should be
                                worn for 20 to 22 hours per day. However, unlike with braces, you have the flexibility
                                to remove
                                your aligners to eat and drink what you want during treatment. And you can also remove

                                are no metal brackets or wires that could cause irritation to your mouth, an advantage
                                over
                                traditional braces. Plus, since your office visits during treatment don't involve metal
                                or wire
                                adjustments, you'll likely spend less time in the doctor's chair. Smilealign allows you
                                to view
                                your virtual results and treatment plan before you start so you can see how your

                                teeth will look when your treatment is complete. Instead of imagining how much better it
                                can be,
                                you'll be able to see it for yourself.</a>

                                your aligners to eat and drink what you want during treatment. And you can also remove
                                the
                                aligners to brush and floss as you normally would, for fresh breath and good oral
                                hygiene. There
                                are no metal brackets or wires that could cause irritation to your mouth, an advantage
                                over
                                traditional braces. Plus, since your office visits during treatment don't involve metal
                                or wire
                                adjustments, you'll likely spend less time in the doctor's chair. Smilealign allows you
                                to view
                                your virtual results and treatment plan before you start so you can see how your
                                straightened
                                teeth will look when your treatment is complete. Instead of imagining how much better it
                                can be,
                                you'll be able to see it for yourself.</a>
