                            Smilealigners straightens teeth using a series of invisible aligners that are digitally made
                            to your teeth. SmileAligners virtual 3D Software moves the teeth to its final position.
                            As you replace each aligner every 12-14days, your teeth will
                            move gradually towards the final position as prescribed.

                            Smilealigners aligner is a CAD/CAM based aligners system
                            used to treat different types of malocclusion with the help of series
                            of aligners manufactured through a unique process of virtual positioning of teeth
                            with the help of software and then prototyping the data with the help of high end 3D printers.
                            Smilealigners introduces digital virtual setup and 3D printing technology and which revolutionises

                        LIMITATIONS OF BRACES</h3>
                    Although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions,
                    they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages. Conventional
                    orthodontic treatment is associated with:
                    <ul class="ul_list" >
                        <li><b>UNATTRACTIVE APPEARANCE : </b>Braces call attention to the patientâ€™s condition and
                            treatment.
                            In addition, braces trap food, which can further compromise appearance. Braces can also
                            result in
                            permanent discoloration of teeth. Many adults associate braces with adolescence.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>ORAL DISCOMFORT : </b>Braces are sharp and bulky and can abrade and irritate the
                            interior surfaces of the mouth. The tightening or adjustment of braces results in root
                            and gum soreness and discomfort, especially in the few days immediately following an
                            orthodontic visit.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>POOR ORAL HYGIENE : </b>Braces compromise oral hygiene by making it more difficult to
                            brush
                            and floss. These problems can result in tooth decay and periodontal damage. Additionally,
                            the
                            bonding of brackets to teeth can cause permanent markings on the teeth.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>INABILITY TO PROJECT TREATMENT : </b>Historically, dental professionals have not had
                            means to model the movement
                            of teeth over a course of treatment. Accordingly, they must rely on intuition and judgment
                            to plan and project
                            treatment. As a result, they cannot be precise about the direction or distance of expected
                            tooth movement between patient
                            visits. This lack of predictability may result in unwanted tooth movements and can limit the
                            their ability to estimate
                            the duration of treatment.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>PHYSICAL DEMANDS ON DENTAL PROFESSIONAL : </b>The manipulation of wires and brackets
                            requires sustained manual dexterity
                            and visual acuity, and may place other physical burdens on the dental professionals.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>ROOT RESORPTION : </b>The sustained high levels of force associated with conventional
                            treatment can result in root resorption, which is a shortening of tooth roots. This
                            shortening
                            can have substantial adverse periodontal consequences for the patient.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>EMERGENCIES : </b>At times, braces need to be repaired or replaced on an emergency basis.
                            Such emergencies cause significant
                            inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional.
                        </li>
                        <li>Smilealigners aligners are transparent / invisible. These are a cosmetic & hygienic alternative
                            to
                            the conventional metal braces. Many adults spend their entire lives covering their mouths
                            when they laugh,
                            smile or talk. They feel stuck because they do not want to wear braces due to pain,
                            irritation, discomfort and
                            social inhibitions. Now there is an effective, safe and clinically proven cosmetic solution
                            that fits your lifestyle.

                            inhibitions due to unsightly braces
